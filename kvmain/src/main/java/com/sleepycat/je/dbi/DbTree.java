 * DbTree represents the database directory for this environment. DbTree is
 * itself implemented through two databases. The nameDatabase maps
 * databaseName-> an internal databaseId. The idDatabase maps
 * databaseId->DatabaseImpl.
 *
 * For example, suppose we have two databases, foo and bar. We have the
 * following structure:
 *
 *           nameDatabase                          idDatabase
 *               IN                                    IN

 *
 * Databases, Cursors, the cleaner, compressor, and other entities have
 * references to DatabaseImpls. It's important that object identity is properly
 * maintained, and that all constituents reference the same DatabaseImpl for
 * the same db, lest they develop disparate views of the in-memory database;
 * corruption would ensue. To ensure that, all entities must obtain their
 * DatabaseImpl by going through the idDatabase.
 *
 * DDL type operations such as create, rename, remove and truncate get their
 * transactional semantics by transactionally locking the NameLN appropriately.
 * A read-lock on the NameLN, called a handle lock, is maintained for all DBs
 * opened via the public API (openDatabase).  This prevents them from being
 * renamed or removed while open.  See HandleLocker for details.
 *
 * However, for internal database operations, no handle lock on the NameLN is
 * acquired and MapLNs are obtained using a fast map lookup in a cache
 * maintained here, as described below.
 *
 * - The ConcurrentHashMap DB cache contains all in-use DBs. Calling getDb
 *   adds the DB to the cache and releaseDb allows it to be evicted or
 *   deleted. A cache is used because the Btree lookup and record lock
 *   overhead is too large to do this for every operation, for example, for
 *   every log entry processed by the cleaner or replica replay. getDb is also
 *   called when a DB is opened by the app, and releaseDb is called when it is
 *   closed by the app, to keep the DB in cache during this period.
 *
 * - The MapLN's BIN latch is held while adding it to the cache. Every DB also
 *   has an access latch in the DatabaseImpl. The access SH-latch is held
 *   while the DB is in use (in which case it is also cached). The getDb
 *   method acquires the SH-latch. The access EX-latch and BIN latch are held
 *   while removing a DB from the cache during eviction and MapLN deletion.
 *   The access latch is not held while the DB is cached but not in use.
 *
 * - A SemaphoreLatch is used for the access latch rather than a thread-based
 *   SharedLatch because access latches are sometimes acquired in one thread
 *   and released in another thread. For example, a DB may be opened by the
 *   app in one thread and closed in another, and replica replay may wish to
 *   obtain a DB in a replay preprocessor thread but release it in the main
 *   replay thread. To avoid deadlocks the order for blocking locks is always:
 *     1. DB's access latch, 2. MapLN's BIN latch, 3. MapLN's record lock.
 *
 * - Per-thread caches may be used to avoid the SH-latch and ConcurrentHashMap
 *   lookup for each operation. The getDb method with a Map param is useful
 *   in such cases. However, such caches must be frequently cleared (via the
 *   releaseDb method with the Map param) to support DB deletion. Such
 *   caches are of questionable value and may be removed in the future.
 *   However, one thing that is useful is to cache the deleted state of a DB;
 *   this is because the DB is not in the DbTree cache, so each time getDb is
 *   called a Btree lookup must be performed. Better yet, we should add a
 *   deleted DB size limited set to DbTree and check it before doing the Btree
 *   search.
 *
 * - One may ask why the MapLN record's read lock is not held while MapLN
 *   is in cache, to avoid the need for the DB access latch. One reason is
 *   that record read locks must be released to support obtaining a record
 *   write lock when the MapLN needs to be flushed by modifyDbRoot to update
 *   the root LSN, during checkpoints for example. Perhaps this can be improved
 *   in the future by using a different lock (e.g., BIN latch, root latch)
 *   to protect the root LSN. But another reason not to use a record lock for
 *   accessing the DB is that record locking is much more expensive than
 *   latching; a record lock adds a locker object to a lock owners list, while
 *   a latch just increments an atomic counter.
 *
 * Regarding DB eviction, note that removing the DB from the cache is only
 * needed when the entire MapLN is evicted. It's possible to evict all INs
 * including the root IN of a database without removing it from the DB cache
 * (or closing it in the app), since that doesn't interfere with the
 * DatabaseImpl object identity.
 *
 * Why are the retry loops necessary in the DbTree methods?
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Three methods that access the MapLN perform retries (forever) when there is
 * a lock conflict: getDb, modifyDbRoot and deleteMapLN.  Initially the retry
 * loops were added to compensate for certain slow operations. To solve that
 * problem, perhaps there are alternative solutions (increasing the lock
 * timeout).  However, the deleteMapLN retry loop is necessary to avoid
 * deleting it when the DB is in use by reader operations.
 * }
